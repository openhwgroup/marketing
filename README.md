# Guideslines for blogs

The goal of the OpenHW Group blog program is to provide a singular place for quality content, hosted on the OpenHW Group website. The blog serves as a channel for the OpenHW Group members and working groups to share content with the OpenHW ecosystem.

The OpenHW Group blog program is designed to showcase OpenHW members in the following topic areas:
- Technical information & advancements,
- OpenHW projects,
- Reports from conference events and presentations regarding OpenHW Group presentations or projects,
- Industry commentary and relevant insights about the developments in the OpenHW and Open-Source ecosystem.

**Note that these content pieces are meant to carry informational/educational value, not product endorsements.**

## Blog Audience

The OpenHW Group blog audience is a combination of business and technical audiences, students, and the community who want to learn about the OpenHW Group. Content that teaches, talks about technical challenges and how they have been solved, industry commentary and relevant insights, and how-tos are valuable content for our audience.

## Content Guidelines

Posts from members must be vendor-neutral and not include marketing content. Product endorsements are not permitted.
- All content should be universal to OpenHW topics.
- The post may mention a vendor’s name as it relates to their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the ecosystem.
- Posts should not feel like an advertisement for your services or company.
- Critical commentary or broad issues must be approached with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is comparative and positive for the community.
- Members can add one to two sentences at the end of their blog with a link to an external site, such as their website or a gated asset. We will review the statement, as we do for the content for the blog, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.
- We highly encourage providing an image or two with your blog to be placed as a featured image. Images in the blog are valuable for helping enhance the content in your blog. 
- Your post must be your content. All blogs should have an author along with their headshot and short, two sentence biography. All images should be shared with proper image sourcing. 
- Announcements or press releases are not to be posted to the blog page. 

## Process

To submit a blog for consideration, please send your submission to Michelle Clancy at michelle@openhwgroup.org.  We plan to post two blogs per month to the OpenHW Group website.

The submitted content will be reviewed by the OpenHW Group team for applicability to OpenHW Group and the ecosystem.  Submitters will either receive an email with a proposed date of blog posting, or if it’s not suitable for the blog program, we will provide feedback and direction.
All contributed content is subject to approval by the OpenHW Group staff.  Once content is approved, OpenHW Group marketing will publish the blog on www.openhwgroup.org 

## Types of Promotion

- Call to members for content: This will be done in the Marketing Committee meeting and with monthly emails to the marketing email list.
- Promotion of the blog content: Published blogs are promoted via the OpenHW Group social channels (Twitter and LinkedIn) and in the monthly newsletter to OpenHW members and ecosystem partners. We encourage you to amplify the social posts with your audience.
